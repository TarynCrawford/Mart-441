For this assignment, we added Javascript to an html page. We also used css to add a background color to the webpage. Comments where also added to each of the page to explain what the code is doing.
In the console.log I answered 3 different questions. My favorete websites, my favorete games, and my favorete artists. 
I was quickly able to create the console.log and background so I challanged myself with making a javascript funtion that will allow me to display an image. I used this to allow you to see some samples of work from the artists I mentioned.
After creating my desired funtion as show_image and setting a variable, I created buttons in the HTML page for the three different artist using that function. After attaching the embeddied images and making sure the code works. I went ahead and played with some fun css to get the buttons to stand out.
I started with a basic color, and fonts, then used border radius to round the corners. To make it more noticable when you hover over the button, I added button hover to the css that change the box shadow to a noticable green, as well as rotates the button.
