Mart-441 HW7 ReadMe
For this assignment I decided that I was going to show a progression of my anime style digital artwork that I have done over the year. I have always been able to see where I have improved in my work by going though them, but I thought that the random feature of this assignment will help me notice what it is I keep doing the same in all my artworks. By flipping though them at random I can see what seems repetative in my style and what I want to improve with it, rather than focusing in progression over time. So that was my insperation going into this assignment. 
It took me some work to figure out how to get it to store in the arry as well as use the objects randomly, But after looking back at the course webpage and rereading everything it became a lot clearer.
