#441 HW-11
For this assignment, I have a moving block that the player needs to avoid. Every time the player is hit the screen flashes red and the player decreases in size. Eventully when the player gets to a small enough size they lose the game. 
This took me a little while to get working right as the blocks where struggling with me to appear on the canvas. However going back though my code line by line I realized that I has a capalization in my variable that I did not use when I was trying to recall the object. So at least it was an easy fix!
