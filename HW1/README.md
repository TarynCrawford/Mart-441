I had a lot of fun working on this assignment. It has been a while since I worked with HTML and CSS so it was a great practice for me.
Some things like the basic pages structure came naturally to me, however I struggled a bit at getting the Parallax to work with both the body and the hero image at the top.
I also had to look up how to link to different sections of the webpage as I am use to only adding links to different web pages. Suprisingly creating a single page site is not something I am use too compaired to multi-page sites.
I had fun experiementing with the design of the site using the parallax and found myself putting in images of my life within it. 
I also wanted to jump from the color to a black and white background when the image boxes are displayed for some contrast.
