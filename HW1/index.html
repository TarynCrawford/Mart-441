            <p>
                I see the good and bad in everything. There is no such thing as a selfless act as even the most noble of deeds can come with some self-gratification for doing the right thing.
                As humans we are born with flaws, but we grow, learn, laugh, and love. We can see rain as inconvient and cold, but also beautiful and relaxing. 
                So while everyone may not agree with your goals and dreams, their is good and bad in everything...
            </p>
            <p>
                so why not do what makes us happy?
