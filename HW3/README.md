For this assignment, we used JavaScript to create our own choose your own adventure story. I thought this was a lot of fun because I remember reading them as a child, so I was really motivated to make it happen in a digital format. Even though I have worked with functions before, it has been a while. So I found myself analyzing the code you made available though codepen in the DOM section of our course website. Even though that example was on the HTML page, I was able to utilize the “document.getElementById("changeme").innerHTML = "I have been changed";” inside of the else if functions in my actual javascript page. I wanted to do this because I like to make sure to keep everything organized, so I prefer to keep script out of my main HTML page if I know I am going to be using it a lot.. and I used that particular line of code a LOT during this project.

I also struggled with organization for a while. As my adventure takes you down many different paths for different lengths. I found myself constantly losing which statement I was going to work on next. To fix this, I created the entire script in Microsoft word so that I could physically see all of the branches in my story. Then I broke them down into different sets depending on how many questions you had to answer in order to get there. This allows me to make different grouping in the JavaScript code myself that made the organization much more manageable.
