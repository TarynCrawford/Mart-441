# 441 HW-13
This assignment was very interesting. I decided to go with the cakewalk sprite, however it wasn't quite complete, so I had to
edit it in GIMP to get it to work for my needs, and after flipping the animation, it worked great! It was really fun to be able to
make a game using HTML, and I found myself playing with it probably longer than I should have.
