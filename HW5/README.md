# Mart-441 HW5 ReadMe 
For this weeks assignment started to create a matching game by creating different Arrays. I used a total of 6 different images. 5 for the matching game and one to represent the backs of the cards. We also used a random array with a limilter that makes sure that each image only appears twice. That way we can prevent an odd number of matches. 

I found this assignment to be pretty simple and strightforword and I am excited to expand upon it next week.
